/**
 * Display the ping to the server. To compute the ping of tetrinet and
 * tetrifast clients we send the <tt>playernum<tt> message that triggers
 * a <tt>team</tt> message as response. We assume the ping is half the time
 * between the request and the response. Since a command cannot wait for
 * a client response this command must work with the PingFilter that is
 * processing all <tt>team</tt> messages. This command sets the client
 * properties <tt>command.ping=true</tt> and <tt>command.ping.time</tt>
 * and send the <tt>playernum<tt> message. The filter will then listen for
 * <tt>team</tt> messages and check if the property <tt>command.ping</tt>
 * is true. If so it will display the ping of the player.
