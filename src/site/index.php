<h1>What is Jetrix ?</h1>

Jetrix is a new generation TetriNET server written in Java and 
designed for maximum scalability, extensibility and ease of use. 
It features a web based administration console and a simple API
to let developpers add custom commands or change the channels'
behavior with little knowledge of the server's inner functioning. 
The ambitious goal of this project is to create the ideal plateform 
for server side TetriNET programmers. Jetrix is open source and 
developped under the <a href="license.php">GNU General Public License</a>.
