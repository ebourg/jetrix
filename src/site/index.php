<h1>What is JetriX ?</h1>

JetriX is a new generation TetriNET server written in Java and designed for maximum scalability and extensibility. It features a pluggable filter and command API allowing easy channel behavior customization that requires little knowledge of the server's inner functioning. The ambitious goal of this project is to create the ideal plateform for server side TetriNET programmers. JetriX is open source and developped under the GPL.
