Jetrix TetriNET Server                   http://jetrix.sourceforge.net

What is Jetrix ?

  Jetrix is a new generation TetriNET server written in Java and 
  designed for maximum scalability, extensibility and ease of use. 
  It features a web based administration console and a simple API
  to let developpers add custom commands or change the channels'
  behavior with little knowledge of the server's inner functioning. 
  The ambitious goal of this project is to create the ideal plateform 
  for server side TetriNET programmers. Jetrix is open source and 
  developped under the GNU General Public License.

Installing & Running Jetrix

  You need a JRE 1.5 or higher installed on your server to run Jetrix.
  You can download it here : http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

  Unix

  Once the Java Runtime Environnement is installed, you'll need a 
  JAVA_HOME environnement variable pointing to your Java directory. 
  For example on Linux you can add this line to your /etc/profile file:

    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk_1.4.2

  Then decompress the Jetrix archive to the installation directory:

    tar -jxvf jetrix-x.y.z.tar.bz2

  To start the server, type the following commands in the jetrix directory:

    ./jetrix

  To start the server as a background process, type:

    nohup ./jetrix &

  Or even better if the screen tool is available on your system, type:

    screen ./jetrix
    
  And then detach from the process with CTRL+A CTRL+D

  To download the latest release and upgrade your version (experimental), 
  type:

    ./update


  Windows

  Install the Java Runtime Environnement and then run the Jetrix installer 
  (jetrix-x.y.z-installer.exe). This will create a "Jetrix TetriNET Server" 
  group in your Start menu, just click on "Jetrix TetriNET Server" to
  start Jetrix, an icon will appear in the system tray. You can click on 
  this icon to open a menu and stop the server or open the administration 
  console.
