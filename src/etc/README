What is JetriX ?

  JetriX is a new generation TetriNET server written in Java and 
  designed for maximum scalability and extensibility. It features a 
  pluggable filter and command API allowing easy channel behavior 
  customization that requires little knowledge of the server's inner 
  functioning. The ambitious goal of this project is to create the 
  ideal plateform for server side TetriNET programmers. JetriX is open 
  source and developped under the GNU General Public License.
